# UFOs
## Software
- javascript
- html
- VisualStudio
- Google Developer Tools

## Overview
The goal was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse through data around UFO sightings. The data is rather extensive, so it needed to be user friendly.

## Results
The webpage initially was able to parse through different UFO data with respect to the date. Later, we added more filters for the dataset. Originally, there was a button for the search. We upgraded the button to automatically filter on change to clean up the website and make it even more user friendly with the dataset.

Now, in order to perform a filtered search, the user only needs to add exactly matching data into the fields and press "Enter" on their keyboard. The filtered search on the left will automatically parse through the data on the right side of the screen and leave you with only data that matches the input data.

## Summary
Using javascript and html properly to build a website that is userfriendly and able to parse through data is simple and can be very clean looking. With minimal effort we were able to produce a functional website to look through a large dataset. 

A key drawback to this method is the database size. In order to call a larger data set, a database must be integrated. 
Moving into the future, it would be nice to have a fuzzier search for the filters. It would also be nice to store the last used filter so it can be recalled immediately (much like an undo button. I would also add a button to automatically export the data into a user-friendly format. 

This was a great build!
